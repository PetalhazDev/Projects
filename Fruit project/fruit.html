            <div class="sec-content-div flexible">
                <p>We are a group of people with decades of experience ingrowing and selling apples. We know what a good apple looks like and how they are grown. This essential fruit requires a temperate climate, loamy soil that is rich in organic matter apart from needing proper drainage and aeration facilities. Lucky for us we live in Kashmir which is proudly known as paradise of earth is also home to temperate fruits like apple for which the state is very famous across the globe. The main factor which influence temperate fruit bearing trees is soil, climate and environment which are highly favorable and unparalled in the province of Kashmir. Kashmir apples are a unique look, flavor, size and color.
